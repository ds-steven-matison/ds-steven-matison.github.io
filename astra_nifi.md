# What is NiFi?

If there is anything I love more than Astra, Postman, and Ansible, its [NiFi](http://nifi.apache.org/).  Apache NiFi is a software project from the Apache Software Foundation designed to automate the flow of data between software systems.  It is super powerful tool I have been using for a few years to develope data flows and data pipelines.  With NiFi I can do just about anything without writing a single line of code.   You can use NiFi's invokeHttp processor for any Astra API calls.  You can also use native NiFi Cassandra Processors (QueryCassandraRecord, PutCassandraRecord, and PutCassandraQL) against Astra.

More coming soon here...
