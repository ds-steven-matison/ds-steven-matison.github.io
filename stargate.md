# What is Stargate?

Stargate is an open source api framework for data which makes the database administration task for any application more accessible by adding developer level support for all turnkey database operations.  Check out the [Stargate Website](https://stargate.io/), the [Stargate Github](https://github.com/stargate/stargate), and the [Stargate Documentation](https://stargate.io/docs/stargate/0.1/quickstart/quickstart.html).  If you are chatty they even have a 
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/33mKDHHFUE).

# Learning Stargate

The best way for me to learn any new API is to read the documentation and build the samples.  Stargate was no exception with 3 different APIs I need to learn:

1. The REST API for CRUD calls such as: Create, Update, Read, Delete.  
2. The Document API for CRUD access to Documents Data in JSON.
3. The GraphQL API for interacting with Stargate using entire Graph Query Language feature. 

To give you a head start I have already created and tested everything in Postman.

# Check Out My Github Repo
Before getting started with Stargate & Postman download, fork, or clone my github repo which contains a Postman Environment and all of the sample calls you will find in the Stargate Documentation.   There is even a folder of sample calls for GraphQl.
