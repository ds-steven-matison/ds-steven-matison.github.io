# What is NoSQLBench?

NoSQLBench is an open source, pluggable, nosql benchmarking and testing suite that was recently released to the open source cassandra community by DataStax.  You can read all about noSQLBench over on the DataStax blog [here](https://www.datastax.com/blog/nosqlbench).  Be sure to check out the noSQLBench [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench) and [Docs](http://docs.nosqlbench.io/).  For the purpose of my blog, I am going to dive right into actually contributing to NoSQLBench.
