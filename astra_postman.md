# What is Postman?

Postman is an amazing tool that every developer should already have in their back pocket.  If you do not have Postman get it [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).  Once you have Postman installed check out my Astra Postman Demo repo on Github for super fast way to get started leveraging Astra with Postman.

# Check Out My GitHub Repo

Before getting started with Astra & Postman download, fork, or clone my github repo which contains a Postman Environment and all of the sample calls you will find in the Astra API Reference.
