# What is an Application Framework?

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_framework) - "In computer programming, an application framework consists of a software framework used by software developers to implement the standard structure of application software."

There are many application frameworks that use Apache Cassandra as a backend data storage solution.  Any of these applications using cassandra drivers (java,python,php) are compatible with Astra. Any application frameworks allowing REST API calls are also compatible with Astra.

Have a cassandra based application framework not listed above?  Need help migrating your application to Astra?  Reach out and tell me more about your framework and I will complete a free astra compatability test.
