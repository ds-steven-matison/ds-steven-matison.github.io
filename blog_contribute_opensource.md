# How To: Contribute to Open Source

During the entire span of my career and even in my personal use of computers and technology I have consistently used Open Source Software over any licensed products.  Once question I often get asked is:  

&nbsp;<b><i>How do I get started contributing to open source projects?</i></b>

My short answer to this questions is always:  just jump in feet first.   There is no right or wrong answer here, everyone who takes an interest in contributing to open source projects will take their own unique approach.  As a first step,  you need to decide on an open source project you want to contribute to.  This may be driven by personal excitement for emerging technologies.  Often times the desire to get involved is driven by internal initiatives in your workspace to build prototypes.  Whatever it is that drives you, use this to also drive your enthusiasm to get involved.   Afterall, this is how open source works.
